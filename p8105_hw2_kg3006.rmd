## Load Libraries
These are all the libraries for this homework assigment 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Probelm 1 
Problem 1 uses the FiveThirtyEight data which we will need to upload the pols-month.csv, unempoloyment.csv, and snp.csv. Goal is to merge into a single dataframe using year and month as keys. 
###Cleaning pols-month.csv
#### Load the data
```{r}
pols_month <- 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
```
Has 9 variables, mon is date, others are all numeric. 

#### Separating Date into year, month, date 
Current structure is "YYYY-MM-DD", we will separate into year, month, day. 
Also will remove the day variable in this step
```{r}
pols_month <- 
  pols_month %>%
  separate(col = mon,
           into = c("year", "month", "day"),
           sep = "-") %>% 
  select(-day)
```

#### Changing month from numeric 
replacing variables in month from numeric value 1-12, to it's corresponding month. 
```{r}
pols_month <- 
  pols_month %>%
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == "01" ~ "January",
    month == "02" ~ "February",
    month == "03" ~ "March",
    month == "04" ~ "April",
    month == "05" ~ "May",
    month == "06" ~ "June",
    month == "07" ~ "July",
    month == "08" ~ "August",
    month == "09" ~ "September",
    month == "10" ~ "October",
    month == "11" ~ "November",
    month == "12" ~ "December"
  ))
```

#### Create a "president" variable 
Creating a new variable "president" based on prez_gop if 1==gop, and prez_dem if 1=dem. and removing prez_dem and prez_gop.  
```{r}
pols_month <- 
  pols_month %>%
  mutate(president = case_when(
    prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem"
  )) %>%
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem)
```

### Cleaning snp.csv 
#### Load the data
```{r}
snp <- 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
```
There are two variables here. The first is the date which needs to be cleaned and go to the front, and the second is the close, which is the closing value fo the S&P 500 index. 

#### Separating Date into year, month, date
Current structure is "M/D/YY", we will seperate into year, month, day and remove day. Also making year come first then month
```{r}
snp <- 
  snp %>%
  separate(col = date,
           into = c("month", "day", "year"),
           sep = "/") %>%
  select(-day) %>% 
  select(year, month, everything()) 
```
##### Chaning month from numeric to month name
```{r}
snp <- 
  snp %>%
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == "1" ~ "January",
    month == "2" ~ "February",
    month == "3" ~ "March",
    month == "4" ~ "April",
    month == "5" ~ "May",
    month == "6" ~ "June",
    month == "7" ~ "July",
    month == "8" ~ "August",
    month == "9" ~ "September",
    month == "10" ~ "October",
    month == "11" ~ "November",
    month == "12" ~ "December"
  ))
```

##### Year needs to match prior 
Year here has 2 digits, need to make it 4 digits to match prior dataframes by adding 19 to characters 50 - 99 and 20 to characters 00 - 25.
```{r}
snp <- 
  snp %>%
  mutate(year = case_when(
    as.integer(year) >= 50 ~ paste0("19", year),
    as.integer(year) <= 25 ~ paste0("20", year)
  ))
```

### Cleaning unemployment.csv
#### Load the data
```{r}
unemployment <-
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
```
There are 13 columns, the first is Year which is numeric and needs to change to character

#### Changing Year
Changing from numeric to character 
```{r}
unemployment <-
  unemployment %>%
  mutate(Year = as.character(Year))
```
It also needs to be renamed from Year to year to match other dataframes
```{r}
unemployment <-
  unemployment %>%
  rename(year = Year)
```

### Changing month 
Month data representes the percent of unepolyment in each month. This will need to be pivoted from wide to long format  for month
```{r}
unemployment <-
  unemployment %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Jan:Dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment_rate")
```
I will also need to chagne month from shorten 3 word name to full name 
```{r}
unemployment <-
  unemployment %>%
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == "Jan" ~ "January",
    month == "Feb" ~ "February",
    month == "Mar" ~ "March",
    month == "Apr" ~ "April",
    month == "May" ~ "May",
    month == "Jun" ~ "June",
    month == "Jul" ~ "July",
    month == "Aug" ~ "August",
    month == "Sep" ~ "September",
    month == "Oct" ~ "October",
    month == "Nov" ~ "November",
    month == "Dec" ~ "December"
  ))
```

### Merging all three dataframes
Now that all three dataframes are cleaned, we can merge them using year and month as keys with left_join
```{r}
merged_data <-
  pols_month %>%
  left_join(snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>%
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

### Description of datasets 
This combined dataset contines information gathered from the FiveThirtyEight data. Each dataset is arranged into year of month of the data. The pols_month dataset was informative in the party affiliation of the president in power during each year-month time interval. It also contains infomration on the number of senators, representitives, and governers during this time period. The snp dataset contains each year-month closing value of the S&P 500 index, and finally the unempolymenbt dataset contains the unemployment rate for each year-month time interval.

The **dimentions of the dataset** are `r nrow(merged_data)` observations and `r ncol(merged_data)` variables/columns.

**Key variables include**:  
- year  
- month  
- president  
- close (S&P 500 closing value)  
- unemployment_rate  

The dataset **starts on `r first(merged_data$year)` and ends in `r last(merged_data$year)`**.

## Problem 2 
In this problem we use the excel file 2024_09_Trash_Wheel_Data.xlsx which as 3 sheets of importance "Mr. Trash Wheel", "Professor Trash Wheel", and "Gwynnda Trash Wheel". We will clean each sheet seperately and then merge. 

### Loading Mr. Trashweel data 
Specification include cleaning column names, removing columns that are missing, removing rows without dumpsters, adding dataset for merging, reorganizing, and making sport balls into integers. 
```{r}
mr_trash_wheel <- 
  read_excel("./Trash/2024_09_Trash_Wheel_Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>% 
  select(-...15, -...16) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate (dataset="mr_trash_wheel") %>% 
  select(year, month, dataset, everything()) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

### Loading Professor Trash Wheel data
Column names here need to be cleaned, there are no additional variables that are added too so we don't have to remove those columns. There is also no sports balls, so we don't have to create that step
```{r}
professor_trash_wheel <-
  read_excel("./Trash/2024_09_Trash_Wheel_Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate (dataset="professor_trash_wheel") %>%
  select(year, month, dataset, everything()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) 


```
### Loading Gwynnda Trash Wheel data
Similar here, no additional columns created and there is no sports ball variable to mutate. 
```{r}
gwynnda_trash_wheel <-
  read_excel("./Trash/2024_09_Trash_Wheel_Data.xlsx",
                     sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate (dataset="gwynnda_trash_wheel") %>%
  select(year, month, dataset, everything()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster))
```

All data has month, year dumpster. We will go through each one and then merge by month and year. 

### Cleaning Mr. Trash Wheel data
#### looking at data
```{r}
head(mr_trash_wheel)
```
